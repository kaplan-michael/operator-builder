## Description
This is an operator that aims to automate building operators for the OKDerators project.
the OKDerators project is a project that aims to rebuild upstream operators for the OKD platform using tekton pipelines.

- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**
